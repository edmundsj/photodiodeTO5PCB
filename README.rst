TO-5 Photodiode Breakout Board
=================================

This PCB is used for a 3-pin TO-5 photodiode breakout board with SMA output. The cathode is connected to the diode case and grounded for better shielding, the traces are kept as short as possible, and the board is kept as compact as possible. 

Features:
-------------
- Extremely compact design
- ESD protection with optional low-noise SMD diodes and series resistor
- SMA output
